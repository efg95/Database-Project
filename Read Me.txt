This is a database project done by me and Lingyu An

This database project is suppose to help a fronthouse restaurant manage its fronthouse information:
* Number of customers
* Food/Menu
* Orders
* Servers 
* Deliveries
* Delivers
* Deliverers
* Tables (which are currently occupied and currently unoccupied)
* Managers
* bills
* what an order includes
* which waiter serves which table
etc. 

TO SEE ALL FUNCTIONS OF THE PROJECT ME AND LINGYU HAVE INCLUDED A VIDEO THAT YOU CAN WATCH HERE AT THIS LINK
